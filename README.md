This is the Senior Project (Final Project) to achieve my Computer Engineering Degree. Its a group of 2 person project. Me and my friend manged to design, trouble and assemble. In this project, we had used openCV library and Tennis ball detection python code from somewhere which I couldn't find the source. At the end of the day, there is a defense presentation and we could defense all the question quite well.
Step 1 Install python and opencv on working Raspberry Pi
Step 2 Install Arduino IDE on PC
Step 3 Read the document file in /doc and Follow the design
